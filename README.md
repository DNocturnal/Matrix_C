# matrix  

Implementation of the matrix.h library.   

## 1. Implementation of the matrix.h library functions

Implement basic operations with matrices: 
`create_matrix`,
`remove_matrix`, 
`eq_matrix`, 
`sum_matrix`, 
`sub_matrix `,
`mult_matrix`,
`mult_number`,
`transpose`,
`determinant` ,
`calc_complements`,
`inverse_matrix`.

- Prepare full coverage of library functions code with unit-tests using the Check library
- Unit tests must cover at least 80% of each function (checked using gcov)  
- Provide a Makefile for building the library and tests (with targets all, clean, test, matrix.a, gcov_report)
- The gcov_report target should generate a gcov report in the form of an html page.
